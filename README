timepicker is a jQuery plugin for providing time selection for web forms.

This version is based on jquery.timepicker.js from http://code.google.com/p/jquery-utils/wiki/UiTimepickr
We removed the dependency on jQuery UI and stripped out the 24 hour option.
It is licensed under the MIT license.

To run with nodejs:

$> npm install connnect
$> node server.js

browse to http://localhost:8080/
